# Cryptocurrencies
In this module, unsupervised machine learning was used to analyze cryptocurrency data

## Project Overview
   Unsupervised machine learning techniques were use to analyze cryptocurrency data for trading market, which these techniques are good for clustering algorithm and easier to determine if investment is worth or not. 

   In this project, we had preprocessing the dataset, reducing data dimensions using PCA, creating clusters using K-means, and creating visualization for results.
